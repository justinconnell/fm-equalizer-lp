## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vite build tools

### What I learned

- Making extensive use of CSS grid makes scaling layouts simpler because it handles 2 dimentional layouts very well.
- Flexbox is still ideal for easily laying out one dimentional such as centering and aligining content.
- CSS3 handles nesting styles which saves some typing.
- It's possible to style a page with more than one background image.

### Continued development

I will still be using vanilla CSS and JS for the next project. Once I have the basics licked, I'll proceed on to frmaeworks.

### Useful resources

- [Using multiple backgrounds](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_backgrounds_and_borders/Using_multiple_backgrounds) - helped clarify how to handle two background images
